# CSS Hacks

A bunch of (mostly small) quality of life improvements for different websites.

## Netflix
- [Blur Synopses](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Netflix/Netflix-blur-synopses.user.css) unless you hover over them.
- [Fullscreen Outro](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Netflix/Netflix-fullscreen-outro.user.css) until the episode is really over.

## Twitter
- [Soft Twitter](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Twitter/Soft-Twitter.user.css) to bring back those nice pillow shapes.
- [Shutter Ads](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Twitter/Twitter-Shutter-Ads.user.css), if you want to make promoted tweets smaller without _quite_ blocking them.

## YouTube
- [SentimentalTube](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/YouTube/SentimentalTube.user.css), so the like ratio layout isn't confusing.
