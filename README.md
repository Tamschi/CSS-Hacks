# CSS Hacks

A bunch of (mostly small) quality of life improvements for different websites.

How to use:

First install the Stylus extension:
- Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/
- Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne/

Afterwards, visit any of the links below and you should see an installation button.

## Ecosia, DuckDuckGo & Google (Image Search)
- [Pinterest Marker](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Google-Images/Google-Images-Pinterest-Marker.user.css) tells you at a glance which image results are from there.

## Netflix
- [Blur Synopses](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Netflix/Netflix-Blur-Synopses.user.css) unless you hover over them.
- [Fullscreen Outro](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Netflix/Netflix-Fullscreen-Outro.user.css) until the episode is really over.

## Twitter (**Old layout only!**)

These all broke when Twitter reimplemented their web version with React.  
The new web app has *completely atrocious* DOM structure and doesn't expose meta data, so I can't fix them.

- [Meta Colours](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Twitter/Twitter-Meta-Colours.user.css) shows meta information via background colours.
- [Poll Spoiler](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Twitter/Twitter-Poll-Spoiler.user.css): Peek at current poll percentages by hovering over the options.
- [Soft Twitter](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Twitter/Soft-Twitter.user.css) to bring back those nice pillow shapes.
- [Shutter Ads](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Twitter/Twitter-Shutter-Ads.user.css), if you want to make promoted tweets smaller without _quite_ blocking them.
- [Tall Images Inline](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Twitter/Twitter-Tall-Images-Inline.user.css): No (image) cropping.
- [Trend Size](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Twitter/Twitter-Trend-Size.user.css) to see at a glance what's popular.
- [Tweet Reasons](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/Twitter/Twitter-Tweet-Reasons.user.css), to know why certain tweets appear when they do.

## YouTube
- [End Card Opacity](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/YouTube/YouTube-End-Card-Opacity.user.css): Adds transparency to end cards on YouTube unless you hover over them, so you can still see the video behind.
- [No Pause Overlay](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/YouTube/YouTube-No-Pause-Overlay.user.css): Gets rid of the pause overlay with suggested videos (in the embedded player, for example) that's easy to accidentally click on.
- [SentimentalTube](https://gitlab.com/Tamschi/css-hacks/raw/master/YouTube/SentimentalTube.user.css), so the like ratio layout isn't confusing.
